      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I am a candidate web developer. My strong passion has me to delve into
        the web development realm without real world experience, but rather a
        great understanising of technogy and its tremendous implications in my
        life. such passion for web development, as well as the ability to learn
        prgramming ligics qucikly have made the learning curve seemless, with
        regards to the challenges that come with it. I am currently building my
        first "HELLO WORlD" project. Welcome to my Profolio project!

      <h1>Experience</h1>
      <p>
        Great working knowledge of web development languages, such as HTML, CSS
        and JavaScript. This portfolio is, perhaps, the greatest evidence of my
        web development experience.
