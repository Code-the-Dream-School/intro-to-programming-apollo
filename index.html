        <h2 style="font-size:25px">About:</h2>
        <p>Hi my name is Zarah, i go by the Pronouns - She/Her. I'm currently majoring in computer science<br>at Bronx
            Community College of the City University of New York.
            I choose to major in computer science after taking a class<br>in web development which was an introduction
            to
            HTML, CSS and responsive web design techniques; I found the concept of the course very intresting,
            <br>so the following semester I changed my major to computer science. Now i'm obsesed with knowing more
            about technology.
            <br>Fortunately I got an email about "Code The Dream" program where I applied and got accepted to learn how
            to code.<br>
            In the future i hope to get a job as a developer in a tech company where i can utilize my education and
            skills.
