    About:
Hi my name is Zarah, i go by the Pronouns - She/Her.
I'm currently majoring in computer science at Bronx Community College of the City University of New York.
I choose to major in computer science after taking a class in web development which was an introduction to
HTML, CSS and responsive web design techniques; I found the concept of the course very intresting, 
so the following semester I changed my major to computer science. Now i'm obsesed with knowing more about technology.
Fortunately I got an email about "Code The Dream" program where I applied to learn and gain more experience on how to code.
In the future i hope to get a job as a developer in a tech company where i can utilize my education and skills.
